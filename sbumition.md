# üöÄ Student Management System ‚Äî Technical Submission

This document highlights the design choices, architecture decisions, testing strategy, documentation, caching, build and run automation, containerization, error handling, and other strengths implemented across the monorepo.

- Root services: backend (Node.js + Express + PostgreSQL), go-service (Golang microservice for PDF reports), frontend (React+Vite), infrastructure (Docker Compose, Makefiles), database (SQL schema + seeders).
- Evidence in repo: docker-compose.yml, Makefile (root and go-service), backend/src, go-service/internal/*, go-service/api/openapi.yaml, seed_db/*.

## üß† Architecture & Design Principles

- Layered, modular architecture
  - Backend: feature-based modules under `backend/src/modules/*` with middlewares, routes, services, and repositories, keeping domain logic cohesive.
  - Go-service: clean layering with Handler ‚Üí Service ‚Üí Cache/External ‚Üí PDF generator. Interfaces (`internal/service/interfaces.go`, `internal/external/interfaces.go`) enforce low coupling and high testability.
- Service-to-service integration (no DB coupling)
  - The Go microservice never touches the database. It consumes the Node backend‚Äôs REST API (`/api/v1/students/:id`) via `internal/external/backend.go`.
  - Internal authentication is handled via a scoped API key using the `X-API-Key` header; the backend middleware `authenticate-service.js` recognizes and short-circuits internal calls.
- Strict boundary at HTTP
  - End-to-end flow: go-service handler validates ‚Üí service orchestrates ‚Üí external client fetches ‚Üí PDF generator renders ‚Üí cache stores/serves. Changes in one layer don‚Äôt ripple across others.
- Graceful runtime behavior
  - Go service initializes structured logging, dependency wiring, and a web server with graceful shutdown (`cmd/api/main.go`).

## üìú API Design & Documentation

- OpenAPI 3.0 documentation provided for the Go microservice at `go-service/api/openapi.yaml`:
  - Endpoints: `GET /health`, `GET /api/v1/students/{studentId}/report`.
  - Detailed response shapes and error codes including 400/404/429/500/503, with headers like `X-Request-ID` and `Content-Disposition`.
  - Input validation for `studentId` via regex (1‚Äì20 numeric characters), mirrored in handler validation.
- Backend API organized under `/api/v1` with feature routers (`backend/src/routes/v1.js`). Students endpoints provide listing, creation, detail retrieval, update, and status handling with the internal-auth path wired in.

## üß∞ Caching Strategy (Performance & Cost)

- File-backed, content-addressed cache in the Go microservice (`internal/cache/file_cache.go`):
  - Keying: SHA-256 hash of student content (e.g., name, class, section, timestamps) created via `GenerateStudentHash` ‚Üí avoids stale PDFs when the source data changes even if ID remains the same.
  - Storage: PDFs persisted to disk with an in-memory index for fast lookups; old versions for the same student are cleaned on write.
  - TTL-based expiry with a background cleanup worker (runs every minute); expired files removed from disk and index.
  - Optimized happy-path latency: serve-from-cache avoids hitting the backend or regenerating PDFs.
  - Failure-tolerant: cache is optional and non-blocking‚Äîgeneration proceeds even if cache read/write fails.

## üßæ Error Handling & Resilience

- Go microservice uses typed errors (`internal/errors/errors.go`): `NotFoundError`, `ServiceError`, `PDFGenerationError`.
  - Handlers map domain errors to correct HTTP statuses (404, 503, 500) with consistent JSON error envelopes.
  - External client implements retry with exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s) for transient backend failures.
- Backend uses a global error handler (`handle-global-error.js`) with a lightweight `ApiError` abstraction and a catch-all 500 fallback.
- CSRF guard is enforced for browser-originated requests but explicitly bypassed for internal service calls (`csrf-protection.js`), avoiding unnecessary friction for server-to-server traffic.

## üîê Security Posture

- Service-to-service authentication via `X-API-Key` tied to an environment variable (`INTERNAL_SERVICE_API_KEY`) and enforced by `authenticate-service.js`.
- Basic hardening middleware in the Go service:
  - Security headers (`X-Content-Type-Options`, `X-Frame-Options`), no-store cache on sensitive routes.
  - Optional per-IP rate limiting (`internal/middleware/rate_limit.go`) with a simple in-memory limiter, configurable via env.
- CORS policy configured in backend (`src/config/cors.js`) with explicit origins and credential support.

## üìà Observability & Operability

- Request tracing with `X-Request-ID` propagation in the Go service; every request gets a UUID (`request_id` middleware) and is echoed back in responses.
- Structured, contextual logging using Uber‚Äôs Zap across the Go service (request logs, PDF generation, cache hits/misses, retries), ideal for centralized log aggregation.
- Health endpoints:
  - Backend: `/health` returns a simple JSON status for infrastructure checks and Docker health checks.
  - Go service: `/health` probes backend reachability and exposes an overall status (healthy/degraded).

## ‚úÖ Testing & Coverage

- Go service has comprehensive unit tests across service, cache, and handlers. Coverage artifact `go-service/coverage.out` reports:
  - Total coverage: 93.1% statements (computed via `go tool cover -func coverage.out`).
  - Focused tests on edge cases: caching TTL expiry, concurrent access, backend failures, invalid IDs, PDF generation errors.
  - Benchmarks included for performance tracking (`make benchmark`).
- Clear testing ergonomics via Make:
  - `make test`, `make test-coverage`, `make coverage-html`, `make test-unit`, plus lint/vet/fmt targets ensure a predictable CI path.

## üß© Low Coupling, High Cohesion

- Interface-driven design in the Go service decouples components:
  - `ReportService`, `PDFGenerator`, and `BackendService` interfaces enable mocking and substitution without invasive changes.
  - Handlers don‚Äôt know or care if data comes from cache or live backend‚Äîthey depend on the service contract.
- Backend routes are grouped by feature area, maintaining cohesive boundaries and minimal cross-module knowledge.

## üì¶ Containerization & Orchestration

- Docker Compose (`docker-compose.yml`) defines a clean multi-container stack:
  - Services: `postgres` (with health checks), `backend`, `go-service` (PDF).
  - Networking: shared bridge network `school_network` for intra-service communication; the Go service reaches the backend via `http://backend:5007`.
  - Startup order: backend waits for Postgres health; Go service waits for backend via `depends_on`.
  - Health checks: both backend and Go service expose `/health` used by Docker to monitor liveness.
- Backend Dockerfile optimized for production (`npm ci --only=production`), exposed port, and health check.
- Go service Dockerfile uses a multi-stage build for tiny final images (scratch-like Alpine base with CA certs) and an internal health check.

## üõ†Ô∏è Makefiles that Supercharge DX

- Root `Makefile` provides one-command onboarding:
  - `make start` builds images, starts containers, waits for Postgres readiness, and seeds the database automatically from `seed_db/*.sql`.
  - `make logs`, `make stop`, `make restart`, `make docker-clean`, `make db-seed` streamline day-to-day ops.
  - Polyglot dev helpers: `make go-test`, `make node-test`, `make go-fmt`.
- Go service `Makefile` is a complete developer toolbox:
  - Build/run (race), deps management, lint/format/vet, coverage, HTML reports, benchmarks, security scans (`gosec`), Swagger generation, hot reload with `air`.
  - CI-friendly target `make ci` for a compact pipeline.

## üóÉÔ∏è Database Schema & Seeders

- Schema (`seed_db/tables.sql`) covers roles, access control, students (users + user_profiles), notices, leaves, departments, classes/sections, and more with foreign keys and unique constraints.
- Seeders (`seed_db/seed-db.sql`) bootstrap an admin and a realistic set of students, classes, and sections to enable immediate end-to-end testing.
- Utility SQL functions (e.g., `student_add_update`, `staff_add_update`) encapsulate upsert-like behaviors, centralizing consistency rules.

## üñ®Ô∏è PDF Generation Quality

- Professional, readable PDF layout with clear sections: Personal, Academic, Parents, Guardian, Addresses.
- Consistent typography, headers, and a standardized footer with a generated report ID.
- Robust data formatting helpers: safe handling for empty values, ISO date parsing, and boolean rendering (Active/Inactive).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Management

- Environment-driven configuration in both services:
  - Backend uses `src/config/env.js` and `dotenv` to bind secrets and URLs.
  - Go service centralizes config in `internal/config/config.go` with `envconfig` and `.env` support, including toggles for cache and rate limiting.
- Sensible defaults with overrides to support local dev and containerized deployments.

## üß≠ Quality Gates & Runtime Hygiene

- Build and runtime checks:
  - Docker health checks for both backend and Go service.
  - Graceful shutdown handling in Go service.
- Lint/format/vet in Go ensure codebase consistency and correctness.
- Request/response logging with timings promotes swift incident triage.

## üåü What Stands Out

- Thoughtful microservice boundary: the Go service consumes a stable REST contract rather than the DB, enabling independent scaling and evolution.
- Resilience-first design: retries, typed errors, graceful degradation when cache or backend is unavailable.
- DevEx excellence: Makefiles + Docker Compose reduce onboarding to a single command while preserving local flexibility.
- Documentation maturity: OpenAPI spec, README(s), and clear code organization make the system approachable.
- Performance-aware: cached PDFs, content hashing, and targeted cleanup minimize compute and I/O overhead.

## üî≠ Suggested Next Steps (Optional)

- Add backend integration tests to complement the Go unit tests (package.json currently contains a placeholder test script).
- Consider an NGINX/Caddy sidecar for serving the OpenAPI spec or auto-generating Swagger UI for the Go service.
- Persist cache metadata to survive restarts (current design intentionally wipes cache directory on boot for consistency).
- Add distributed tracing headers propagation (e.g., W3C Trace Context) across services for deeper observability.

If you want to try it locally:

- One-command bring-up: `make start`
- Generate a PDF: `curl -L "http://localhost:8080/api/v1/students/1/report" -o student_1_report.pdf`
- View logs: `make logs`
- Stop stack: `make stop`

This stack is production-leaning yet developer-friendly‚Äîrobust building blocks, clean separation of concerns, and the right operational guardrails. üí™
